# Advanced String Operations:
 Implementing StringAlgorithms class for pattern matching using KMP and string compression using RLE.

# Steps

# KMP Pattern Matching:

Implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring search. Create an indexOfKMP method to return the starting index of a pattern in the text.

# Run Length Encoding (RLE):

Write the runLengthEncoding method to perform RLE on an input string, compressing sequences of identical characters.
